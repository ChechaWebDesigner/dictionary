# dictionary

To create this app I used React JS, Tailwind CSS, and HTML.

The api that I used is https://dictionaryapi.dev/. So I have to say thanks for their work. 

About the app, it is going to let you look up differents words and their meanings, synonyms and antonyms. it this app you are going to find the pronunciation of the words.
